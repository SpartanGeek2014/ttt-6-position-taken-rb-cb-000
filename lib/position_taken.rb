# code your #position_taken? method here!
def position_taken(board, index)
    # basic solution:

  taken = nil
  if (board[index] ==  " " || board[index] == "" || board[index] == nil)
    taken = false
    elsif
    taken = true
      else
        taken

  # advanced solution w/ ternary operator
      (board[index] ==  " " || board[index] == "" || board[index] == nil) ?
        false : true
    end
  end
